Card Battler Game Specification

1. Overview
   We are building a card battler game (similar to Hearthstone in structure), using a data-driven architecture in Unity. The game should support both single-player and easy future expansion to multiplayer, and is independent of graphics for now.

2. Core Concepts
   - Each player has a 3x3 battlefield grid (9 cells total). Cards can be placed into these cells.
   - Two types of cards:
     * Unit cards – place a unit on the battlefield.
     * Spell cards – cast buffs on your own units or debuffs on enemy units.
   - Players take turns simultaneously:
     1. Each round, both players play cards and press “End Turn”.
     2. A shared resolution phase begins, where effects and combat play out.
     3. Players see the opponent’s actions only after both have ended their turn.

3. Card Mechanics
   - Draft phase each turn:
     * 4 cards are shown for 20 seconds.
     * Players can replace any number of these cards.
     * Replaced cards return to the deck.
   - Each player has a deck of 30 cards. No reshuffling if the deck is empty.
   - Players can burn one card per turn to gain +1 mana.

4. Battle Phase
   Battle resolution happens in this order:
   1. Positive spell effects (buffs, heals)
   2. Negative spell effects (damage, debuffs)
   3. Passive abilities that trigger “At start of turn”
   4. Combat phase – units fight:
      - Units attack only enemies in the same horizontal row: Front → Middle → Back.
      - If all enemy cells in that row are empty → damage is dealt to the enemy hero.
      - If the hero reaches 0 HP → that player loses.

5. Abilities & Triggers
   Card effects may trigger:
   - When played
   - On unit death
   - On hero taking damage
   - When touching other units (adjacent cells)
   - If more/fewer units than the opponent
   - Based on mana or hand size
   - At start/end of turn
   - If placed in front or back rows

6. Unit Properties (Passive)
   Some unit cards or spell buffs grant:
   - Double strike
   - Vampirism
   - Anti-magic
   - First strike
   - Armor

7. Mana System
   - Turn 1 starts with 2 mana.
   - +1 mana per turn (up to max 9).
   - Hero abilities cost mana (or may be free), and each hero has a unique skill.

8. Hero System
   - Players choose a hero at the start of the match.
   - Each hero has:
     * A unique starting HP value.
     * A hero ability (unique skill) that costs mana to use (may be once per game or reusable).
     * A personal Hero Magic pool consisting of three magics (tiers 1–3) that unlock sequentially.

9. Hero Magic
   - Structure:
     * Each hero begins with Tier1 magic unlocked.
     * When a Tier’s magic reaches its maximum level, the next Tier unlocks.
     * Each hero has exactly three magics: one per Tier.
   - Experience Requirements:
     * Tier1 magic requires 1, 2, and 4 XP to reach levels1,2, and3, respectively.
     * Tier2 magic requires 2, 4, and 7 XP for levels1,2, and3.
     * Tier3 magic requires 4, 8, and 12 XP for levels1,2, and3.
   - Casting:
     * Hero Magic cards are cast similarly to spell cards and consume mana.
     * Some Hero Magics have a limited use count (e.g., can be cast only once per match or up to N times).
     * Upon reaching the final level of Tier3, no further XP is gained for Hero Magics.
   - Effects:
     * Hero Magics can deal damage, apply buffs/debuffs, heal heroes or units, or trigger other special effects.
     * Effects and triggers follow the same resolution order as regular spells and abilities.

10. Data-Driven Architecture
    - All cards, units, spells, and hero data are defined in external data files (JSON, ScriptableObjects, etc.).
    - New content (cards, heroes, magics) can be added without code changes.
    - Resolution engine reads definitions at runtime and applies effects according to specified rules.

11. Future Multiplayer Expansion
    - Turn actions are recorded and synchronized between clients.
    - Deterministic resolution based on both players’ actions to avoid desyncs.
