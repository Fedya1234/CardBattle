AI Coding Assistant Prompt: Card Battler Game Overview
We are building a card battler game (similar to Hearthstone in structure), using a data-driven architecture in Unity. The game should be developed in a way that supports both single-player and easy future expansion to multiplayer, and is independent of graphics for now.

Core Concepts
Each player has a 3x3 battlefield grid (9 cells total). Cards can be placed into these cells.

There are only 2 types of cards:

Unit cards – place a unit on the battlefield.

Spell cards – cast buffs on your own units or debuffs on enemy units.

Players take turns simultaneously:

Each round, both players play cards and press “End Turn”.

Then, a shared resolution phase begins, where effects and combat play out.

Players see the opponent’s actions only after both have ended their turn.

Card Mechanics
Each turn starts with a draft phase: 4 cards are shown for 20 seconds.

Players can replace any number of these cards.

Replaced cards return to the deck.

Each player has a deck of 30 cards. No reshuffling if the deck is empty.

Players can burn one card per turn to gain +1 mana.

Battle Phase
Battle resolution happens in this order:

Positive spell effects (buffs, heals)

Negative spell effects (damage, debuffs)

Passive abilities that trigger "At start of turn"

Combat phase – units fight

Units attack only enemies in the same horizontal row:

Front → Middle → Back row.

If all enemy cells in that row are empty → damage is dealt to the enemy hero.

If the hero reaches 0 HP → that player loses.

Abilities & Triggers
Card effects may trigger:

When played

On unit death

On hero taking damage

When touching other units (adjacent cells)

If more/fewer units than the opponent

Based on mana or hand size

At start/end of turn

If placed in front or back rows

Unit Properties (Passive)
Some unit cards or spell buffs grant:

Double strike

Vampirism

Anti-magic

First strike

Armor

Mana System
Turn 1 starts with 2 mana.

+1 mana per turn (up to max 9).

Hero abilities cost mana (or may be free), and each hero has a unique skill.
